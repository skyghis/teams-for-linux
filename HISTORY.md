# History

This branch was a child fork of [JamieMagee teams-for-linux](https://github.com/JamieMagee/teams-for-linux) repo, that was itself a fork of [Ivelkov teams-for-linux](https://github.com/ivelkov/teams-for-linux).

Jamie did express his desire to refactor this project in Typescript and to support it, but he has archive the project and I suspect that means he doesn't have the time to support it.

I have tried to contact Ivelkov for a few months but haven't receive any answers.

For that reason, decided to refork it and fix a few things that where not working. The list has grown since then to support many features and to fix most of the bugs.

To be able to use a few github functionalities, it was decided to unfork the project [#87](https://github.com/IsmaelMartinez/teams-for-linux/issues/87).

Ideally this project will die when Microsoft implements a desktop client for linux. Please do vote for it in the [Microsoft Suggestions Forum](https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/16911565-linux-client)

Currently, the project is in a stable condition, and should continue as long as needed. Non stable versions are released as pre-release.
